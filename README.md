# Race game
Developed cool race game with ability playing on the Internet! In this developed a 3D racing game in Unity there are online multiplayer, gate navigation, dynamic music changes, camera perspective switching, and player record display. Served as the foundation for exploring architectural patterns like MVP and Observer, enabling the creation of more modular, maintainable, and flexible logic. Built on Unity's Netcode stack, facilitating online multiplayer gameplay.

Player can dynamically change camera view by clicking on the keycode R on the keyboard:

After completing all loops, player can see his own record and records another player. Also, he can restart race by clicking button:

Added simple system of drive a car to gates by training and integrating neural network. I have used package ML Agents, Pytorch library and reinforcement training for faster preparing neural network to drive a car by my experience. Still in development. Here you can see, how trained neural network tries to drive a car:
